Steps to complete this project


1. Wrote out the wireframe. Thought about how many collections, componants and models were necessary.
2. Broke the game down in bite-sized chunks. A single question vs a column of questions vs a whole game.
3. Started with a hardwired html and copy and pasted pieces off as I went
4. First started playing with the API. Figuring out how to get the data from the server to show first in the console, then in the log.
5. Added collections and models to have firm ways of pulling data from the server.
6. Got stuck on pulling the answers into a scoreboard to add to the collection.
